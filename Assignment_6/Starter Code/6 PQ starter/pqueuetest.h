 * ------------------------
 * Tests the use of the priority queue to implement a sort algorithm.  Enqueues
 * a bunch of values into pqueue and then pull them out using dequeueMax to arrange in
 * array in sorted order.  Tries it with random data inserted and then two more times
 * with data inserted in sorted order (both forward and backward) to learn how
 * the performance is affected by already sorted data.

/*
 * Function: PQSort
 * Usage: PQSort(arr, n);
 * ----------------------
 * Uses the priority queue to sort an array.  Inserts all values from array into
 * a pqueue and then pulls them out with dequeueMax and assigns into array into
 * sorted order.  Depending on the running times of the underlying PQueue, this 
 * can be a pretty decent sorting algorithm (for example, when using heap implementation
 * this is effectively HeapSort). This routine is exported since it is used by
 * the performance module as well as the test module.
